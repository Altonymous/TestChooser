*****************************
Install py-appscript
*****************************

Sublime Text 2 uses its own Python and its version is 2.6.
We need to install appscript with the same version that Sublime is using.

`sudo easy_install-2.6 appscript`

This will create "appscript-1.0.0-py2.6-macosx-10.7-intel.egg" file in /Library/Python/2.6/site-packages

In Sublime, choose "Preferences"->"Browse Packages"

Copy the .egg file into the "Installed Packages" folder and restart Sublime.
